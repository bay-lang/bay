- Define product types (structs)
- Define sum types (enums)
- Define shared behavior (traits)
- Nullability with types like i64? and unwrapping with ? operator
- Universal error enum with tag word that describes the type, then pointer word that points to the associated data. The ! operator is used to unwrap errors
- `const {}` blocks that are evaluated at compile time
- Type narrowing/subtypes/subsets for sum types
- The compiler and type system are all embedded in the standard library to allow runtime compilation and execution of embedded programs
- Macro system for manipulating code at compile time, would like to find a way to have some that will take in raw tokens and others that will take in type-checked token trees
- Simple concurrency with a model similar to Go's, you can `.await` a function to have it run concurrently as a task, or `.unawait` to get a handle that can be used to manipulate and run the function later
- Can pattern match in function definitions
- Named function arguments
- Try contexts or similar `try fn` or `try {}` that allow you to short circuit execution with a `.try` keyword, also a similar concept maybe for nullability and error handling maybe with `try!` and `try?` definitions/blocks
